Now, let's suppose we have a page like this for every lecture in a course. 
At the beginning, there will be some text, like this, then an enclosed, browseable presentation, then some further text or notes.

This is lecture 123 and thus the slides, as noted in the header, will be in pdf/slides123.pdf.

## Further notes
